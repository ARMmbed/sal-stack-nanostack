 * \brief 6LoWPAN Library Socket API
 *
 * \section socket-com Common Socket API
 *  - socket_open(), A function to open a socket
 *  - socket_free(), A function to free a socket
 *  - socket_raw_open(), A function to open a raw ICMP socket
 *
 *
 * \section socket-read Socket Read API at Callback
 *  - socket_read(), A function to read received data buffer from a socket
 *  - socket_read_info(), A function to read signal information and length info from a socket
 *  - socket_read_session_address(), A function to read a session info for TCP event
 *
 * \section socket-tx Socket TX API
 * - socket_send(), A function to write data buffer to a socket (TCP Client Only)
 * - socket_sendto(), A function to write data to socket to specific destination
 *
 * \section sock-connect TCP Socket Connection Handle
 *  - socket_listen(), A function to set the socket to the listening mode
 *  - socket_connect(), A function to connect to remote peer
 *  - socket_close(), A function to close a connection
 *
 * Sockets are common abstraction model for network communication and are used in most operating systems.
 * The 6LoWPAN Library API follows BSD socket API conventions closely with some extensions necessitated by the event-based scheduling model.
 *
 * Library supports following socket types:
 * | Socket name    |   Socket description           |
 * | :------------: | :----------------------------: |
 * | SOCKET_UDP     |   UDP socket type              |
 * | SOCKET_TCP     |   TCP socket type              |
 *
 * \section socket-raw ICMP RAW Socket Instruction
 * ICMP RAW socket can be created by socket_raw_open(). When using ICMP sockets the minimum payload length is 8 bytes, where first 4 bytes form the ICMP header.
 * The first byte is for type, second for code and last two are for checksum which must always be set to zero.
 * Stack will calculate the checksum automatically before transmitting the packet. Header is followed by the payload.

 * | ICMP Type |    ICMP Code | Checksum  | Payload    | Notes           |
 * | :-------: | :----------: | :-------: | :--------: | :--------------:|
 * | 1         | 1            | 2         | n (min. 4) | Length in bytes |
 * | 0xXX      | 0xXX         | 0x00 0x00 | n bytes    | Transmit        |
 * | 0xXX      | 0xXX         | 0xXX 0xXX | n bytes    | Receive         |
 *
 * ICMP echo request with 4 bytes of payload (ping6).
 *
 * | ICMP Type |    ICMP Code | Checksum  | Payload             |
 * | :-------: | :----------: | :-------: | :-----------------: |
 * | 0x80      | 0x00         | 0x00 0x00 | 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 |
 *
 * ICMP echo response for the message above.
 *
 * | ICMP Type |    ICMP Code | Checksum  | Payload             |
 * | :-------: | :----------: | :-------: | :-----------------: |
 * | 0x81      | 0x00         | 0xXX 0xXX | 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 |
 *
 * \section socket-receive Socket receiving
 * When there is data to read from the socket, a receive callback function is called with the socket event parameter from the library.
 * The state of the TCP socket then changes and the socket TX process is ready (SOCKET_TX_FAIL or SOCKET_TX_DONE).
 * Socket event has event_type and socket_id fields. The receive callback function must be defined when socket is opened using socket_open() API.
 *
 * All supported socket event types are listed here:
 *
 * | Event Type                 | Value | Description                                                         |
 * | :------------------------: | :---: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------: |
 * | SOCKET_EVENT_MASK          | 0xF0  | NC Socket event mask                                                |
 * | SOCKET_DATA                | 0x00  | Data received, Read data length from d_len field                    |
 * | SOCKET_BIND_DONE           | 0x10  | TCP connection ready                                                |
 * | SOCKET_TX_FAIL             | 0x50  | Socket data send failed                                             |
 * | SOCKET_CONNECT_CLOSED      | 0x60  | TCP connection closed                                               |
 * | SOCKET_CONNECT_FAIL_CLOSED | 0x70  | TCP connection closed ï¿½ no ACK received                             |
 * | SOCKET_NO_ROUTER           | 0x80  | No route available to destination                                   |
 * | SOCKET_TX_DONE             | 0x90  | Last Socket TX process Done, at TCP case Whole TCP Process is ready |
 *
 * When socket call back is called application need to handle event and read data from the socket socket_read().
 * Read operation release memory from stack when read is called or after callback automatic.
 *
 *
 * \section socket-tcp How to Use TCP sockets
 *
 * | API                           | Socket Type   | Description                                                    |
 * | :---------------------------: | :-----------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
 * | socket_open()                 | Server/Client | Open socket to specific or dynamically port number.              |
 * | socket_close()                | Server/Client | Close opened TCP connection                                      |
 * | socket_listen()               | Server        | Set server port to listen state                                  |
 * | socket_connect()              | Client        | Connect client socket to specific destination                |
 * | socket_send()                 | Client        | Send data to session based destination                           |
 * | socket_sendto()               | Server/Client | Send data to specific destination                            |
 * | socket_read_session_address() | Server/Client | Function read socket TCP session address and port information. |
 *
 * When TCP socket is opened it is in closed state. It must be set either listen or to connect state before it can be used to receive or transmit data.
 *
 * Socket can be set to listen mode by calling socket_listen() function. After the call the socket can accept an incoming connection from a remote host.
 * Listen mode closes the connection automatically after server timeout or when client or application closes the connection manually by socket_close() function.
 *
 * TCP socket can be connected to a remote host by calling socket_connect() with correct arguments. After the function call (non-blocking) application must wait for the socket event to confirm the successful state change of the socket.
 * After the event of successful state change data can be sent using socket_send()  by client and socket_send() by server call.
 * Connection can be closed by calling socket_close() function or by server timeout.
 *
 * \section socket-udpicmp How to Use UDP and RAW Socket
 *
 * UDP socket is ready to receive and send data immediately after successful call of socket_open() and NET_READY event is received.
 * Data can be transmitted by using socket_sendto() function. ICMP socket works with same function call.
