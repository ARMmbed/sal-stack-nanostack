ARM IPV6/6LoWPAN stack.
=======================

This repository contains ARM IPv6/6LoWPAN stack for mbed OS.

Documentation is hosted in http://docs.mbed.com/projects/arm-ipv66lowpan-stack/

On mbed OS the preferred usage is through [mbed Mesh API](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-mesh-api) that provides required wrappers between Socket abstraction layer and this stack.

See example application [mbed-client-example-6lowpan](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-example-6lowpan) for example usage.

See module [sal-iface-6lowpan](https://github.com/ARMmbed/sal-iface-6lowpan) for known limitations.
