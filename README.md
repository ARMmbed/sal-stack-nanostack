ARM IPV6/6LoWPAN stack.
=======================

This repository contains the ARM IPv6/6LoWPAN/Thread Stack for mbed OS.

![](docs/img/thread_certified.png)

mbed OS is now a Thread Certified Component. Using IPv6 with 6LoWPAN as the foundation, Thread technology provides a low-power, self-healing mesh network designed for the home.

The documentation is hosted in http://docs.mbed.com/projects/arm-ipv66lowpan-stack/

On mbed OS, usage is through [mbed Mesh API](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/latest/APIs/communication/mesh/) and [Socket API](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-api-reference/en/latest/APIs/communication/network_sockets/).

To see, how the 6LoWPAN Stack works, check the example application [mbed-os-example-mesh-minimal](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-mesh-minimal).
